# D3A
Here we will release the dataset of a 2.5D environment that was used for the D3A algorithm. 

**Project Overview** An 1-min overview of the project can also be found on the following link: https://youtu.be/N33cJTomrQY </br>

**[Update 10/8]** Sample images collected by our personal assistant robot Kuri have been released.</br>

The sub-directory containing the sample data is arranged as follows:<br />
* sample/bounding_boxes: contains the bounding boxes of the objects detected by the detector<br />
* sample/images: original images captured by the robot<br />
* sample/sample_data_info.xlsx which contains the processed data(including ground truth information) of every object instance detected in the sample images by the detector. </br>

The sub-directory lab_environment_visualization includes the map for the robotics lab and one sample trajectory video of the robot showing the environment and the objects in the environment. </br>

The dataset is being cleaned and will be released in the Fall. We will be slowly populating this link with sample images and corresponding sensor data. If you have any questions or want a copy of the dataset earlier, please contact ifrah_idrees@brown.edu
