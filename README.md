# D3A
Here we will release the dataset of a 2.5D environment that was used for the D3A algorithm. 


**[Update 18/1]** Sample images collected by our personal assistant robot Kuri are released. The directory is arranged as follows:
sample/bounding_boxes: contains images with the bounding boxes of the objects detected by the detector
sample/images: orignal images captured by the robot

The sample folder also incldes the map of the environment and a excel sheet with the predicted and ground truth information of the objects detected by the detector.

The dataset is being cleaned and will be released by the end of Feburary. We will be slowly populating this link with sample images and corresponding sensor data. If you have any questions or want a copy of the dataset earlier, please contact ifrah_idrees@brown.edu
