# D3A
Here we will release the dataset of a 2.5D environment that was used for the D3A algorithm. 


**[Update 18/1]** Sample images collected by our personal assistant robot Kuri have been released. The directory is arranged as follows: \newline
* sample/bounding_boxes: contains the bounding boxes of the objects detected by the detector \newline
* sample/images: original images captured by the robot \newline

The sample folder also includes the map of the environment and an excel sheet with the predicted and ground truth information of the objects detected by the detector.

The dataset is being cleaned and will be released by the end of February. We will be slowly populating this link with sample images and corresponding sensor data. If you have any questions or want a copy of the dataset earlier, please contact ifrah_idrees@brown.edu
